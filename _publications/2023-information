We adapt previous literature on search tasks for developing a domain-specific search engine
that supports the search tasks of policy workers. To characterise the search tasks we conducted two
rounds of interviews with policy workers at the municipality of Utrecht, and found that they face
different challenges depending on the complexity of the task. During simple tasks, policy workers face
information overload and time pressures, especially during web-based searches. For complex tasks,
users prefer finding domain experts within their organisation to obtain the necessary information,
which requires a different type of search functionality. To support simple tasks, we developed a web
search engine that indexes web pages from authoritative sources only. We tested the hypothesis that
users prefer expert search over web search for complex tasks and found that supporting complex
tasks requires integrating functionality that enables finding internal experts within the broader web
search engine. We constructed representative tasks to evaluate the proposed systemâ€™s effectiveness
and efficiency, and found that it improved user performance. The search functionality developed
could be standardised for use by policy workers in different municipalities within the Netherlands
