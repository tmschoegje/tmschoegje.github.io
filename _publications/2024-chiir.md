Expert search systems help professionals find colleagues with specific expertise. Expert search results can be presented as a list of
documents with their associated experts, or as a list of candidate
experts with evidence for their expertise based on documents they
authored. The type of result may affect search behaviour, and therefore search task performance. Previous work has not considered
such effects from the result presentation, focusing instead on how
to rank experts or on ways to interact with the search results.
We compare the task performance of novice users using either a
document-centric interface (where each search result is a document
and its associated expert) or a candidate-centric interface (where
each search result is a candidate expert and their associated documents). We also compare candidate-centric and document-centric
ranking functions per interface.
A post-experiment survey indicated that two variables affect
which interface participants preferred: the retrieval unit (candidates or documents) and the complexity (number of documents per
search result). These variables affected participantsâ€™ search strategy,
and consequently their task performance. A quantitative analysis
revealed that 1) using the candidate-centric interface results in a
higher rate of correctly completed tasks, as users evaluate candidates more thoroughly, and 2) the document-centric ranking yields
faster task completion. Weak evidence of a statistical interaction
effect was found that prevents a straightforward combination of
the most effective interface type and the most efficient ranking
type. Present work resulted in a more effective, albeit less efficient,
search engine for expert search at the municipality of Utrecht.
